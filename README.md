# Dungeon-Generators
A small project to generate rooms in a dungeon for a text-based RPG (currently limited to Numenera) to ease the tasks of a Game Master. 

### State of the Project:
Currently successfully produces variable numbers of generated dungeon rooms with very low crash rate, but only outputs to console, no higher level output yet. In the initial state of this project, I rushed, and produced far too many if statements when a set of lists would have sufficed far better, but it does work. 

### Current Goals:
1. Refactor if statements to lists for second iteration to improve efficiency and practice list management and traversal
2. Write a file writing module to allow for the capability of storing campaign files locally
3. Create gui prototype and begin to test for general user comfort, with hopes of reaching a wider audience
4. Begin work on database as well as interface


### Far Future:
1. Begin work on character management systems, as well as introducing code for other modules
2. Add support for module management
3. Eventual 5e Support
