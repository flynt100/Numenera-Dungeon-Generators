# Dungeon-Generators
A small project to generate rooms in a dungeon for a text-based RPG (currently limited to Numenera) to ease the tasks of a Game Master. 

Current Goals:
1. Refactor if statements to lists for second iteration to improve efficiency and practice list management and traversal
2. Write a file writing module to allow for the capability of storing campaign files locally
3. Create gui prototype and begin to test for general user comfort, with hopes of reaching a wider audience
4. Begin work on database as well as interface


Far Future:
1. Begin work on character management systems, as well as introducing code for other modules
2. Add support for module management
3. Eventual 5e Support
